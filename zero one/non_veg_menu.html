                        <p>Chicken Biryani is a traditional Indian rice dish renowned for its aromatic flavors and tender chicken pieces. It is a popular dish served across India and various other parts of the world, loved for its rich taste and fragrant spices. The dish typically consists of long-grain Basmati rice, marinated chicken, and a blend of spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves.
                           To prepare Chicken Biryani, the chicken is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, which helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor. The rice is parboiled separately with whole spices until it's partially cooked. Then, layers of rice and chicken are assembled in a heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani pot, along with fried onions, fresh herbs like mint and cilantro, and sometimes saffron-infused milk for added aroma and color.</p>
